      <p>“Northerners know nothing at all about Slavery. They think it is perpetual
bondage only. They have no conception of the depth of <span class="it">degradation</span>
involved in that word, SLAVERY; if they had, they would never cease their
efforts until so horrible a system was overthrown.”</p>
